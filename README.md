# odin-recipes
We are going to build a basic recipes website. Making the boilerplate, and elements: like <h1> to show the importance of the differents parts of the recipes. <img> to add images to the page. <ul> and <ol> to structure the differents lists on the recipes. And really importante to <a> anchor the pages to work the links.
