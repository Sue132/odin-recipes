                    <li>¼ cup milk.</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, meltes.</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried chives.</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder.</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
                    <li>Use a toothpick to poke a few holes into each potato.</li>
                    <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until fully cooked, about 1 hour. Cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Cut a thin slice from one side of each baked potato; carefully scoop out flesh and transfer to a large bowl. Discard skins.</li>
                    <li>Mix 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, butter, chives, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into potatoes until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Spread potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with remaining Cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
                </ol>
